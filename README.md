**Introduction** 

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of employee demographics, workforce distribution, hiring trends and work arrangements, using the Human Resources dataset. The analysis aims to support data-driven HR decision-making by highlighting key workforce characteristics, identifying trends, and uncovering insights that guide strategic planning in recruitment and employee engagement.

**Objectives of the Analysis**

The major objectives of the analysis are to:
	understand the demographic structure of employees 
	examine departmental workforce composition  
	assess employee location trends
	evaluate hiring trends over time
	measure workforce stability and engagement using indicators such as average employment duration and the status of employees (active vs inactive).

Information/ Description of Dataset
The dataset consists of 22214 rows and 13 columns. Each row consists of unique information about each employee while the columns include: 
Id, First Name, Last Name, Birthdate, Gender, Race, Department, Job Title, Location, Hire Date, Termination Date, Location City, Location State.
All the columns except Termination Date have complete data points. 82.3% of the Termination Date column was missing.

Data Cleaning and Modification
The dataset was clean so there were no data cleaning processes involved. However, data modification include addition of three columns namely: Age, Employment Duration, and Employment Status.

Challenges
The challenges faced while performing the analysis are as follows:
Missing values in the Termination Date column created confusion because it was hard to determine if employees with those missing values are still active or not. However, during the analysis, it was assumed that employees with the missing termination date are still active since they are not yet assigned termination date.
Also, in year 2000, the total number of hired employees was very low compared with other years. The reason for this sudden drop is unknown yet. Probably the company started operation in year 2000. 

Result of the Analysis
•	Demographic Structure of Employees
Age groups, gender distribution, racial diversity, and average age were examined to understand the demographic structure of employees.
Figure 1 shows the age group of employees in the organization. The chart revealed that the highest number of employees falls within age group between 30 and 39 years, while the smallest number of employees are between 20 and 29 years. However, the average age of the workforce is 41years. 
50.81% of the workforce is male, 46.46% is female while 2.72% is non-conforming (Figure 2).
